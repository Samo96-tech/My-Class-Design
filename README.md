# Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to my first object-oriented programming design! This repository features two core activities that apply the principles of OOP using Python.

## ðŸ”§ Activities Overview

## 1. Class Design

Created a class representing any concept i like e.g., a Superheroâ€”with:

Custom attributes and methods

A constructor to initialize unique values

Inheritance and encapsulation for reusability and security

## 2. Polymorphism Challenge

Implemented multiple classes (like vehicles) that share the same method name (move) but exhibit different behaviors.
